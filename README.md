# BU DS 210 Graph Analysis with Rust Project (Private Repo)

This project focuses on analyzing graphs using the Rust programming language. Rust is a language that prioritizes safety, speed, and concurrency, making it a good choice for graph analysis.

The project is structured in several directories, each containing a different aspect of the analysis. The "data" directory contains the graphs to be analyzed, and the "src" directory contains the Rust code for the analysis. The "tests" directory contains test code to ensure the accuracy of the analysis. Additionally, there is a "README.md" file that provides a brief overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

The analysis performed in this project includes several algorithms, such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, and Dijkstra's algorithm. These algorithms are used to find the shortest path between nodes, the connected components of a graph, and other properties of the graph. The project also includes visualizations of the graphs using the "graphviz" library.


# Project Datasets

The final project will require analyzing a graph. The graph will be either directly provided by a data set, or it will be derived from a data set. We recommend finding a data set and challenge that you find interesting. Below we provide links to a few websites that can help you find a data set.
